# Bedrock Jukebox  
#### Just like the title says, this mod changes the vanilla java jukebox to work like the bedrock jukebox  

Check out [ilmango's video](https://youtu.be/cP-vWpJS4lo) to better understand the changes!  
  
**Changes:**  
- Jukebox now acts like a redstone block its playing music  
- Hoppers, dispensers, etc... can interact with jukeboxes  
- Jukebox now gives block updates when changing, due to the fact that it emits redstone  
  
**Parity:**  
- Jukeboxes still cause shape updates when changing state (intended)
